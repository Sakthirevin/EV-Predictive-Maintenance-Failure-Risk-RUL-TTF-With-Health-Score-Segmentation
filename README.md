# EV-Predictive-Maintenance-Failure-Risk-RUL-TTF-With-Health-Score-Segmentation
This project applies ML and DL to predict failure risk, maintenance types, and RUL for electric vehicles. Leveraging my mechanical design background in industrial vehicles, it showcases a complete data science workflow tailored for real-world predictive maintenance in the automotive domain.
